## What is Pomodoro?  

**Pomodoro** is a thoughtfully designed productivity timer that helps users enhance focus, reduce burnout, and structure work sessions for optimal efficiency. Based on the well-known **Pomodoro Technique**, this app encourages short, timed bursts of concentrated effort followed by regular breaks — improving both consistency and mental clarity.  

The app offers a clean, minimal interface for setting custom work and rest durations. It features **session tracking**, **progress visualization**, and **reminder notifications** to keep you on pace throughout your day. Whether you're studying, coding, or writing, Pomodoro provides a distraction-free environment to help you stay on task.  

Users can personalize sounds, themes, and intervals to match their workflow, while built-in statistics help monitor focus patterns over time. With **seamless background operation** and **menu bar integration**, it stays out of your way while keeping you accountable.  

Pomodoro is ideal for freelancers, students, and professionals who value structure and wish to achieve more through smarter time management — not longer hours.
